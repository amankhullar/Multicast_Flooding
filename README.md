# Geocasting in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks : Location-Based Multicast Algorithms 
This code is the implementation of the paper : [Geocasting in MANETs](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/603c/17e157571f2843cf0891c2ae8a4b0d7d2009.pdf). This paper has been implementated as part of the Mobile Computing Lab (The last lab during undergraduate studies). This has been completed as a group project and presented today to our Head of Department Dr. Dhurendar. The cpp implementation is not complete though the spirit behind the implementation was sheer hardwork! It was absolutely delightful to get a chance to be a part of
this team and work for this project in college and hope to be able to work on similar projects after college too. 

NOTE : For the users who want to install NS2 in MacOS, I would recommend you to install the docker image and simulate the trace files even if NAM is not able to work. [This](https://github.com/ekiourk/docker-ns2) docker image I used.
